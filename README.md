Ultimately, I would like to complete one kata once, using Vim as the editor and using any software language.

Choose a kata. Done. My choice is:

* Intro: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata
* Description: https://thebigfont-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/shaun_bigfont_ca/EXFjh6Hgz-pAgaZPoXxvaaIBawGHvVkRxG-ssn-aI-Oy1Q?e=alp3w4

Read the kata introduction once in its entirety. Done.

Read the kata description once in its entirety. Not done. I decided to start on the first section when I reached it.

Choose a language in which to complete the kata for the first time. Done. C#.

> I suggest you proceed by memorizing it in short sections. Fully learn one section before adding the next.

Code each kata section once. Mark it as 'Done and memorized' once I have coded it once without looking at any notes; otherwise, mark it as 'Done'. 

Move on to the next section only once the previous one is 'Done and memorized'.

* The First Test. Done.
* The Second Test
* The Third Test
* The Fourth Test
* The Fifth Test

Evaluate: 

* What went right? 
* What went wrong? 
* What did I learn? 
* Based on my experience, what is the next step?
