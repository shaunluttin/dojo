Ultimately, I would like to complete one kata once, using Vim as the editor and using any software language.

Choose a kata. Done. My choice is:

* Intro: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata
* Description: https://thebigfont-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/shaun_bigfont_ca/EXFjh6Hgz-pAgaZPoXxvaaIBawGHvVkRxG-ssn-aI-Oy1Q?e=alp3w4

Read the kata introduction once in its entirety. Done.

Read the kata description once in its entirety.**

Choose a language in which to complete the kata.

Code each kata section once. 

* The First Test
* The Second Test
* The Third Test
* The Fourth Test
* The Fifth Test

Evaluate: 

* What went right? 
* What went wrong? 
* What did I learn? 
* Based on my experience, what is the next step?
